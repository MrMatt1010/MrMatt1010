### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt, 2 years ago I was a truck driver, driving up and down the country everyday with 50 tons of freight on board and thinking that I had the greatest office in the world. 
Then I got sick, all of a sudden driving a truck and trailer was no longer an option.
Rather than wallow in the unfairness of it all and with the support of my family I am switching careers. Software Development has always been a passion for me
and now I have the chance I am going to grab it with both hands. 

I have chosen software development because it ticks all the right boxes for me with regards to where I am at in my life. I get to satisfy my curiosity with new technologies and approaches to development. 
I also love learning about developing secure applications. I want to be a part of the industry that is helping to usher in a new and safe digitally connected world. 
Not just for me, but for my children and others out there who do not have the knowledge we possess as a community.

My ultimate goal is to have a career working in the cybersecurity field, helping to protect people's privacy and data.

âš¡ Fun fact: 
Did you know the population of the Earth is made up of more bacteria than human cells? 
It's estimated that for every human cell in your body, there are around 10 bacterial cells! 
These tiny roommates play a crucial role in our health, digestion, and immune system. 
So next time you wash your hands, remember you're not just getting rid of dirt, but greeting trillions of microscopic neighbors!
