### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt, 2 years ago I was a truck driver, driving up and down the country everyday with 50 tons of freight on board and thinking that I had the greatest office in the world. 
Then I got sick, all of a sudden driving a truck and trailer was no longer an option.
Rather than wallow in the unfairness of it all and with the support of my family I am switching careers. Software Development has always been a passion for me
and now I have the chance I am going to grab it with both hands. 

I have chosen software development because it ticks all the right boxes for me with regards to where I am at in my life. I get to satisfy my curiosity with new technologies and approaches to development. 
I also love learning about developing secure applications. I want to be a part of the industry that is helping to usher in a new and safe digitally connected world. 
Not just for me, but for my children and others out there who do not have the knowledge we possess as a community.

My ultimate goal is to have a career working in the cybersecurity field, helping to protect people's privacy and data.

âš¡ Fun fact: 
Did you know that Earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a mythical god or goddess? Instead, its name comes from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil." So while other planets like Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have names derived from Roman or Greek mythology, Earth's name reflects its physical characteristics.
